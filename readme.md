# [WIP] Evil Quick Scope

**Work in progress**: Please note that the code in this repository cannot be
installed normally as an emacs package yet, because the work has not yet been
finished for even the initial release.

With that said though, the majority of the work has been completed. The only
things left to do are:

1. ~~Disable highlighting when in evil-replace-state.~~

2. Figure out how to make this into a minor mode, and hence a proper installable
   emacs package.

I am however busy for the next few days, but I should be able to complete the
above soon after that.
